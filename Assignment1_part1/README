DESCRIPTION: Command-line expression interpreter that implements 
             recursive descent parsing using object orientated programming
             principles.

FILES:

GrammarRule.h : Interface file for GrammarRule. 
GrammarRule.m : Implementation file for GrammarRule.
    GrammarRule is the top level object that all rules inherit. 
    This forms the base for all sub rules.


Expression.h : Interface file for Expression. 
Expression.m : Implementation file for Expression.
    Expression contains the sub rule classes for the Grammar.
    Sub rules are specific implementations of the GrammarRule parent class
    and enforce the grammar.


main.m : 
    The entry into the program.
    Handles the input and initialisation of the first program rule.


Tokens.h : Interface file for Tokens 
Tokens.m : Implementation file for Tokens.
    Tokens handles the parsing of a token from a given string.
    Token types are Number, Literal and OperatorSet.


Variable.h : Interface file for Variable. 
Variable.m : Implementation file for Variable.
    Variable contains the singleton pattern for the varaiable storage 
    Dictionary.
    Variable also contains the variable class that is used to store the key 
    value pairs in the dictionary.
